        <ol><h3>Instructions</h3>
            <li>Fill a large pot (about 12 quart) with 4 quarts water. Stir in onion, garlic, Old Bay seasoning, and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes and season with salt (I use 1 Tbsp). Let cook until potatoes are about nearing tender, about 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add corn and continue to cook 3 minutes. Add sausage and cook 4 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Gently stir in shrimp and cook until just opaque and pink, about 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain mixture (you can reserve 1/4 cup of the broth if you'd like for serving). Spread over an extra large serving platter or a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with butter and lemon juice. Sprinkle with parsley, Old Bay seasoning and pepper to taste, and serve warm.</li>
