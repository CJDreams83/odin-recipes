        <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound medium-large fresh shrimp cleaned (approximately 15-20 count shrimp)</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas and diced carrots blend I don’t thaw and use straight from the freezer</li>
            <li>1/2 cup corn I use frozen straight from the freezer</li>
            <li>2 to 3 garlic cloves finely minced or pressed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>3 large eggs lightly beaten</li>
            <l1>4 cups cooked rice I use white, long-grain or brown may be substituted. To save time use two 8.8-ounce pouches cooked and ready-to-serve rice</l1>
            <l1>2 to 3 green onions trimmed and sliced into thin rounds</l1>
            <l1>3 to 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</l1>
            <l1>1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste</l1>
            <l1>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper or to taste</l1>

        </ul>
        <ol><h3>Instructions</h3>
            <li>To a large non-stick skillet or wok, add the oils, shrimp, and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through. Cooking time will vary based on size of shrimp, don’t overcook. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon (allow oils and cooking juices to remain in skillet) and place shrimp on a plate; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the peas, carrots, corn, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften, stir intermittently.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and cook for 1 minute, stir intermittently.</li>
            <li>Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp, rice, green onions, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, evenly season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until shrimp is reheated through. Recipe is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Reheat gently as desired.</li>
